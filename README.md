# Digital-Dice-Game
This project presents the design and simulation of a digital dice using basic digital electronic components.
A 555 timer IC is used to generate pulse signals, which are applied to a CD4017 decade counter. Selected
outputs of the CD4017 are combined using diodes to represent valid dice values from 1 to 6. These
signals are then applied to a CD4511 BCD to 7-segment decoder, which drives a common anode 7-
segment display. The complete circuit is designed and tested using Proteus simulation software to verify
correct operation.
